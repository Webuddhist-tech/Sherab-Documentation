# 08. Transifex Setup and Management

## What is Transifex?
Open edX supports many languages out of the box. Translating terms (like changing "Submit" to "ཞུགས་པ།" in Tibetan) is managed by a third-party service called **Transifex**.

All translation files (mostly `.po` and `.json` files) are tracked in a repository.

## How WeBuddhist Academy Handles Translations
We use **GitHub Integration** with Transifex. This is the easiest and most automated way.
- When someone translates a string on the Transifex website, it automatically opens a Pull Request to our GitHub repository.
- When we merge that Pull Request, the translation becomes live on our platform!
