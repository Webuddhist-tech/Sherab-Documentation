# 04. Complete Guide to Setting Up E-commerce for WeBuddhist Academy

## What Is This Integration?
We use a **WordPress/WooCommerce** setup to act as the primary storefront for the WeBuddhist Academy project. 
- **WordPress** is the website catalog where users browse.
- **WooCommerce** handles the shopping cart and payments.
- When a user buys a course, the system uses OAuth2 (a secure way APIs talk to each other) to automatically enroll them into the actual course on **Open edX**.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you must have your Tutor development server running (`tutor dev start` or `tutor dev launch`).

---

## 1. Install the WordPress Plugin into Tutor
You don't need to manually configure WordPress or database migrations. Tutor handles this via a plugin!

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
pip install -U tutor-contrib-wordpress
tutor plugins enable wordpress
```

---

## 2. Development Setup

### Launch Tutor
```bash
tutor dev launch
```

### Configure the Development Domain
Add the following to your Tutor config file (`config.yml`):
```yaml
WORDPRESS_HOST: store.local.overhang.io
```
Then save the configuration:
```bash
tutor config save
```
Access the development WordPress site at: [http://store.local.overhang.io](http://store.local.overhang.io)

---

## 3. Production Setup

### Launch Tutor
```bash
tutor local launch
```

### Domain Registration
Register the store domain on **Cloudflare**:
```
store.sherab.org
```

Add the URL to your Tutor config file (`config.yml`):
```yaml
WORDPRESS_HOST: store.sherab.org
```

Then save and apply:
```bash
tutor config save
tutor local launch
```

## Phase 1: Create OAuth2 Application (In WeBuddhist Academy / Open edX)
We must create a secure "key" in Open edX so WordPress is allowed to talk to it.

1. In your browser, go to the Django Admin panel: `http://local.openedx.io:8000/admin`
2. Log in using a staff superuser account.
3. Scroll down to **OAuth2 Provider** -> **Applications** and click **Add Application**.
4. Fill out the form exactly as follows:
   - **User:** Select your staff user account
   - **Client type:** Confidential
   - **Authorization grant type:** Client credentials
   - **Name:** "WordPress Commerce"
5. Click **Save**.
6. The system will give you a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**. **Copy and save these immediately.**

---

## Phase 2: Configure WordPress
Now we give WordPress the key we just generated.

1. Access WordPress by going to `http://local.openedx.io:8080/wp-admin` (dev) or your production WordPress admin URL.
2. Look at the left sidebar menu. Go to **WooCommerce** -> **Settings**.
3. Click on the **Integration** tab at the top.
4. Click on **OpenEdX**.
5. You will see a form. Enter the following:
   - **LMS Domain:** `http://local.openedx.io:8000` (dev) or your production LMS URL
   - **Client ID:** (Paste the ID from Phase 1)
   - **Client Secret:** (Paste the Secret from Phase 1)
6. Scroll down and click **Test Connection (Generate JWT Token)**. If it turns green, you are successfully connected!

---

## Phase 3: Creating a Course Product
Now let's create something to sell!

1. In the WordPress admin sidebar, go to **Products** -> **Add New**.
2. Give your product a name, price, description, and images.
3. Look for the checkbox labelled **OpenEdX Course** and tick it.
4. Two new fields will appear:
   - **Course ID:** The exact ID of the course in Studio (e.g., `course-v1:MySchool+Math101+2024`)
   - **Course Mode:** The type of enrollment (see table below).
5. Click **Publish** on the right side. 

---

### Understanding Course Modes

| Mode | Description | Certificate | Payment Required |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `audit` | Free access, no certificate | No | No |
| `honor` | Free access with certificate | Yes | No |
| `verified` | Paid with verified certificate | Yes | Yes |
| `no-id-professional` | Professional, no ID verification | Yes | Yes |

## How It Works (The Student Experience)
1. Student browses courses in WordPress or the **Catalog MFE** course about page.
2. On a paid course, they click **Buy Course** (Catalog) or purchase from the WooCommerce store.
3. WooCommerce handles the credit card transaction.
4. Our plugin detects the completed order.
5. It uses the OAuth API key to instantly tell Open edX to enroll the student's email address in the mapped `Course ID`.
6. The student logs into Open edX and their course is waiting for them!

> **Catalog MFE:** The course about page shows **Buy Course** when `CourseMode.product_url` is set (via Course API `purchase_link`). The button component lives in catalog Git (`src/plugins/BuyCourseEnrollmentButton.tsx`); the enrollment slot is injected for the server by the `catalog_customization.py` Tutor plugin (`mfe-env-config-runtime-definitions-catalog`), and registered locally via a gitignored `env.config.jsx` for `tutor dev`. See [18 — Catalog MFE Setup](18-catalog-mfe-usage-and-page-differences.md#woocommerce-buy-course-catalog-course-about-page).

## Common Issues / Troubleshooting

- **JWT Token Fails:** Check that you copied the domain, Client ID, and Client Secret accurately. Ensure the User you selected for the Application was a Staff user.
- **Enrollments Not Working:** Confirm that the `Course ID` in the WordPress Product perfectly matches the one in Open edX Studio. Ensure the student's email address on WordPress exactly matches their Open edX account.
